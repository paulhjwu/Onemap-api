# OneMap API Repo

## Project Title: Data Extraction with API - HDB Block Coordinates and Travel Distances between Blocks (OneMap API)

In this repo, I share how I leveraged the OneMap API to extract data relating to selected Singapore location postal codes, latitude-longitude coordinates and travel distance and time (both walking and public transport route types) between locations.

There are 2 files in this repo:
- Jupyter Notebook (Data Extraction with OneMap API.ipynb)
- Excel file (`df_woodlands_south.xlsx`)

Please feel free to share with me your comments, feedback and suggestions!
