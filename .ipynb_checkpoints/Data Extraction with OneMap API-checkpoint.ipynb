    "#### Background\n",
    "This project is part of a Operations Research term assignment to leverage the principles of linear programming (LP) to tackle a real-life problem. The objective was to develop a LP model that can suggest optimal locations to strategically place health wellness centers in the community to engage the most number of elderly individuals (i.e. maximizing coverage), given a set of pre-determined constraints and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code displayed in this notebook shows some of the aspects of data acquisition performed, so as to generate data to feed into the LP model.\n",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria leaves us with 101 blocks which we will use for our LP modelling.\n",

This is because we do not have granular number of elderly individuals per HDB block (data not publicly available), while we only have total number of elderly per subzone from SingStats, including Woodlands South. Therefore we will be doing a random (estimate) distribution based on the total sum. This simulated data is needed for optimization, where we want to maximize the number of elderly we can reach from the placement of our health wellness center locations. \n",

We will proceed to randomize the distribution of this value of 3,030 amongst the 101 HDB blocks."
